I am an independant student at the Université du Québec à Montréal.

Creatively, I am doing the NaNoWriMo right now. Click [here](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/sautumn) to see what I am working on this year. 

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada, more precisely in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, with my lovely cat Satori.
