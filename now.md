I am studying in cultural animation at the Université du Québec à Montréal. I am the person in charge of inclusivity in my program association.

Creatively, I am endlessly working on a presentation that is trying to make sense of mental health and neoliberalism during the pandemic in Quebec. 

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada, more precisely in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, with my lovely cat Satori.
