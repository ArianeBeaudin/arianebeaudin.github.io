I am studying in Software engineering at l’École des technologies supérieures de Montréal.

I am currently unemployed as I am working on multiple personal projects, namely a sci-fi piece whose title is for now *Do Androids Dream of Social Justice*?

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada in the neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve with my cat and a friend.
