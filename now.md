I am studying part-time at the Université du Québec à Montréal.

Creatively, I am exploring glitch art under my [Glitch Witch account on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_theglitchwitch_/) and, on the writing side, I'm trying to organize a body of work around disrupting status quo and resilience.

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada, more precisely in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, with my cat and a friend, but I'm actively trying to move in a housing cooperative in that neighbourhood.
