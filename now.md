I am studying in Software engineering at l’École de technologie supérieure de Montréal.

I am currently unemployed as I am working on multiple personal projects, namely an exploration of glitch art under my [Glitch witch account on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_theglitchwitch_/).

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada in the neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve with my cat and a friend.
