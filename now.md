I am doing an intership at the non-profit [La Puce ressource informatique](https://lapuce.org/), while studying part-time at the Université du Québec à Montréal in Education.

Creatively, I am exploring glitch art under my [Glitch witch account on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_theglitchwitch_/) and, on the writing side, I'm trying to organize a body of work around disrupting status quo and resilience.

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada in the neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve with my cat and a friend.
