I am an independant student at the Université du Québec à Montréal.

Creatively, I am doing the NaNoWriMo right now where I work on a serie of essays about chronic pain and the end of the world (as we know it). 

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada, more precisely in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, with my lovely cat Satori.
