I am studying in Animation culturelle at the Université du Québec à Montréal. I am the person in charge of inclusivity in my program association.

Creatively, I am floating around, working on nothing serious for the moment, waiting to see how the next few months will unfold. 

I live in Montréal, Québec, Canada, more precisely in Hochelaga, with my lovely cat Satori.
