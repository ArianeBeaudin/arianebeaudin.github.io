title: my little list of political anime and 2D movies
---


Just a little list of anime and movies which marked me with their political insights and message of hope.

 1. *Belladona of Sadness* (1973), a Japanese movie inspired by the French novel _La Sorci√®re_ by Jules Michelet (1892)
 This movie illustrates well a fight that is way too often invisible, this fight being the one against patriarchy.
 
 2. *Revolutionary Girl Utena* (1997), a yuri anime and movie  
 Makes me contemplate the idea that there might be an equivalent of capitalist realism but for patriarchy, since the main female characters are (in some way) trying to escape the patriarchal system, and this translates in a quest to reach the End of The World. Also, this anime is a great piece about gender stereotypes and the importance of remaining loyal to our dreams and the ones we love.  I enjoyed [this analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNJ80N1Aoc&t=6304s&ab_channel=Zeria) of the work of *Revolutionary Girl Utena*'s director, Kunihiko Ikuhara.
 
 3. *Shinsekai Yori* (2012-2013), science-fiction anime
 This anime's main subject, in my opinion, is dehumanization and it is brilliantly approached. It also covers colonization, bureaucracy, and the impact of a society ruled by fear.  A very smart critique of human history, and one that let us leave with hopes. 
 
 4. *Rio 2096* (2013), a science-fiction Brazilian movie
On the cyclical aspect of fighting against oppression (as in, it is a fight that always change but never ends).  Also, it serves as a good reminder for activists. Despite the impression that "humanity is actually slacking" in its pursuit of social changes (and so, in such a critical time), it is important to remind ourselves that, at all time in history, there were groups fighting against the oppressive forces (never did humanity just complied as a whole to them), and the fact that humanity now "looks like it is slacking" is not a defeat of morality but the fruit of this game where the oppressors had all the time in the world to think about how to weaken the oppressed and create the conditions for this weakening state to remain constant. 
 5. Hayako Miyazaki's work in general
There is this [nice marxist analysis of Miyazaki's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMXN6B-tqZM&t=1471s&ab_channel=Zeria) to which I would like to come back to.
