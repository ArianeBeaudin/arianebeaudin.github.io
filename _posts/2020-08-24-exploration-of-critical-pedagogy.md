title: exploration of critical pedagogy
---

You can find in my [favorite books](https://ravirer.com/collections/reading_essentials/) *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* by Paolo Freire, but I have only recently discovered his work. Nonetheless, I have been interested in education for a while now (I used to talk about it on [Appprendre comme du monde](www.apprendrecommedumonde.wordpress.com)), and this book sparked my interest again, and it did so toward a more specific field : critical pedagogy.

So here is just a little post to save some resources about it, authors and questions I would like to explore.

 - I have only listened to Paolo Freire's book, I also looked at this very [well done synthesis](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/summary), but I would like buy a copy of it to be able to re-read and annotate thoroughly.
 - I want to borrow an introductory book on the subject of critical pedagogy to have a wider perspective on the subject and makes sure I don't forget any important theory/consideration.
 - I shall continue reading *Tomorrow's Childen : A Blueprint for Partnership Education in the 21st Century* by Riane Eisler and stay alert to find new scholars with similar ideas than hers.
 - I would also like to investigate  a "Pedagogy of Healing", in a sense of how to teach in a way that heals, but also how to teach healing. My personal healing process has been shaped mostly by books, and the ideas I've found in them. I namely wonder how it would have been if I wasn't a book nerd in the first place.
 - I am now somewhat planning to start a Baccalauréat en éducation par cumul de certificats at l'UQAM next year, for which I would possibly do the [Certificat en intervention éducative en milieu familial et communautaire](https://etudier.uqam.ca/programme?code=4031), so I would also like to read about pedagogy/learning/teaching outside the school environment. 
 - I also want to leave here a nice text from *Ouvrage*, [«La reproduction ne sera pas télédiffusée»](http://www.revue-ouvrage.org/la-reproduction-ne-sera-pas-telediffusee/), which summarizes critically how the COVID-19 crisis was handled in Quebec. I think it puts brilliantly how the education is perceived by the Quebec's governement, and highlights well the challenges we'll have to face. I like how the author discussed the tension about technology within the education system. 

As I am writing this, we are entering in Virgo season, which is also back to school season. I am looking forward all the headlines about everything going wrong in the reopening of schools among a pandemic.
