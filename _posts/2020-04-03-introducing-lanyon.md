### Hello, my name is Ariane Beaudin.

I used to describe myself as an environmental activist, but I’m now a bit less invested in the cause as I am exploring some alternative paths that could lead people to conscientização, namely through rethinking personal relationships. I am an anarchist, but I am before all against the current status quo and the injustices and the destruction it brings.
And lately, that’s what I have been doing.

In 2019-2020, I was organizing student strikes and environmental initiatives in the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal. I participated in a panel, on which Laure Waridel was, about environment, where I represented the student population. I also did the animation for an electoral debate in 2019 in the circumscription of Laurier-Sainte-Marie, and a podcast episode about the relevance of student strikes for the climate. All of that while completing an intensive DEC in Computer science from which I graduated in May 2020. I have been awarded the Médaille du Lieutenant-Gouverneur for my implication during those years.

On the writing side in 2020, I have published two articles in L’Heuristique, where I am now one of the correctors. I also have a text to be published in the soon to be launch environmental journal of the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal. I’m also publishing erotic stories on Patreon (for lack of a better place). Before that, I used to rant (constructively) about education on Apprendre comme du monde.

When it goes to programming, I haven’t found the time to squeeze as much extra-curriculum projects as I would have liked. I did help a little for the development of the website of the Coalition étudiante pour un virage environnemental et social (CEVES), where I have learned how important organisation is (by the way, I’m a very efficient scrum master). I currently work on a Discord bot in javascript, The AI Priestess, which provides ‘’esoteric services’’ such as tarot readings and current astrological snapshot. I’m also eternally learning about Linux because I will forever be a Linux user. And I love Neo4j.

Profesionnaly speaking, I can do : 
*-Correction of text (in French) 
*-Writing of all sorts (even personalised erotic stories) 
*-Tarot readings 
*-Some programming, I am so far a jack of all trades (but I’m good at managing teams)
