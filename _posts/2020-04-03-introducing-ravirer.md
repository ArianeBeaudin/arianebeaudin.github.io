### Hello, my name is Ariane Beaudin and Ravirer is my digital garden.

But what is a digital garden? [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden "Joel Hooks") describes it as

> a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

I could also say that Ravirer is my sense-making laboratory.  You'll be able to find here my thoughts on queer utopias and activism namely. You'll find below a more detailed list of topics as my digital garden grows.

If you want to know more about me or what I'm doing, you can jump to the [/about page](http://ravirer.com/about) or the [/now page](http://www.ravirer.com/now). I also write [poetry](http://ravirer.com/poetry).
