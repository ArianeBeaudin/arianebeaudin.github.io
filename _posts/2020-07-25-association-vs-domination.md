## a new framework

This could be some kind of temporary conclusion to the train of thought of [_On Gender Abolition and Matriarchy_](https://ravirer.com/2020/07/01/on-gender-abolition-and-matriarchy/) and [_Speculation on the Impact of the Loss of Matriarchy_](https://ravirer.com/2020/07/02/speculation-on-the-impact-of-the-loss-of-matriarchy/), where, let's remind ourselves, I was examining namely:   

 - Agender society of *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin
 - Womanhood and woman psyche, why is it somewhat broken and how to possibly "fix it"
 - What would mean the come-back of matriarchy

I left those texts thinking matriarchy didn't sound quite right to me, as I'm interested in non-hierarchical systems and as I still have the impression that genders are some not-that-usefull constructs nowadays. 

And then I fell upon *The Chalice and the Blade* by Riane Eisler (1987) and I was delighted to discover a brilliant framework that would suit so well my inner-comprehension of the world. 

Riane Eisler, with *The Chalice and the Blade*, revisits history, from prehistory through our time, with a feminist and critical perspective. She also tries to create a new language to talk about the duality humanity faces, and I will try to use this new language myself in the future. 

This post is not an attempt at writing a synthesis of this book, but I shall leave here the [Wikipedia page on the theory developed in it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chalice_and_the_Blade), since I think it is well constructed. But if we want to sum up the main ideas, Eisler suggests namely that :  

 - the nature of humanity's history is cyclical, as in we are oscillating between two models of culture/society
 - those two models would be the domination model (patriarchy) and the partnership model (matriarchy), which is translated in French in *modèle d'association* 
 - but to interpreted that as a war on gender is not productive (and not accurate), therefore Eisler creates new words to describe patriarchy and matriarchy, respectively *andocraty* and *gylany*.  
 - to think outside the gender limitation, she put the emphasis on the symbolism of the chalice and the blade : whereas the chalice gives life the blade take it, and we have been in a society ''ruled by the blade'' for a while now
 - with archeological data, she suggests that past society that were labelled as matriarchy were not truly ruled by women, but closer to her partnership model where everybody is equal
 - she also suggests that utopian society like the lost city of Atlantis probably existed (it would have been the Mycenaean people ), and that therefore we can expect society to reach "utopian standards" in the real world

That's enough bullet points for today. But I haven't reached the most interesting part in my opinion, at least, the most interesting part for my intellectual revolutionary pursuit. 

In her work, she portrays women as an historical force porteur du flambeau of the partnership model. And for the domination model to thrive they had no choice but to repress manifestation of this alternative vision, and that could explain why women suffered so much throughout history. She states that period of peace and of cultural development must have been followed by a belligerent period namely in an attempt of the domination model to reaffirm his superiority in glorifying its values, namely courage, competitiveness and strength.   

Because the thing is, according to Leisler, that to have a strong domination model, (toxic) masculinity must be strongly valued in one's society. And this is the idea that sparked the most excitement in me.

I always was into the "queer cause", but I remember a moment while I was very involved in environmental activism I thought that it was pointless to "advocate for such issues if the world is going to die (because of climate changes) anyway", thought that I totally discard today. But reading Leiser's book was like an ah-ah moment allowing me to connect yet another dot in the schema of the complex world we live in. 

Even if identity politics aren't unanimously considered pertinent of powerful enough to promote big-scale social changes, Leisler's idea bring an interesting  take on it. To personally refuse the gender binary, or the stereotypes link to genders,  is one piece in the puzzle of shattering everything to the ground. And [I already said it](https://ravirer.com/2020/06/05/diversity-of-tactics/), but will say it again : diversity of tactics is essential. It makes me happy to be able to picture my own struggle and micro-rebellious acts as part of a bigger guerrilla machine. 

So I just let the seed sink in : I am looking forward deepening this idea, but for now I am very excited to continue to explore Riane Eisler's theory. I borrowed her *The Real Wealth of Nations : Creating a Caring Economics*, which sounds capitalistic, but *The Chalice and the Blade* showed me anarchy occupies a place in her heart, therefore I should probably not worry too much.
