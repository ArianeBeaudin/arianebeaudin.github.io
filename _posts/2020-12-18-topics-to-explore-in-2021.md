description: What I am planning to study and do in the upcoming year of 2021
---

I honestly don't think I'll be able to stick to any plan in 2021. I am always changing my plans. But here's a few certainty for 2021 :
- I will do at least one semester in Animation culturelle at UQAM.
- I will try TELUQ's system by taking at least one class from the Majeure en Ã©ducation aux adultes.
- I will run for mayor in the upcoming municipal elections in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

Regarding those facts, here some stuff I absolutely want to study in my spear time or throughout my school project :
- Municipalism and history of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve
- Critical analysis of school (bell hooks, Eli Meyerhoff)

And then in general, here's a few things I'd like to try in 2021:
- Actually read more sci-fi novels than texts about the revolutionary potential of sci-fi novels
- Also read, write and submit more poetry (and essays?) to magazines
- Do at least 1 workshop/bookclub on a political topic
- Record podcasts for real
- Create a platform to cover the municipal elections/connect with people through the municipal elections

On a more personal side, I'd like to continue :
- To study tarot, namely through Lindsay Mack's classes
- To deepen my astrological practices by learning more about aspects, synastry and medical astrology
- To persevere in my investigation at the intersection of divinations tools and activism
- To read more about indigenous spiritualities
- To read muslim feminists and Tunisian writers
- To practice glitch art and painting and drawing and dancing
- To get better at taking care of a variety of plants
- To deepen my care praxis and understanding of the ethics of care
