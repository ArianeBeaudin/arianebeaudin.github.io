I am a multifaceted being who especially enjoys writing and sense-making. You can go on my [/now page](http://ravirer.com/now) to know what I'm currently doing. 

In those recent years, I was busy doing a Technique intensive en informatique at the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal, from which I graduated in June 2020. I was also involved in the organization of student strikes for the climate and other social and ecological initiatives in the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal.

On the writing side, I used to rant (constructively) about education on [Apprendre comme du monde](wwww.apprendrecommedumonde.wordpress.com/). And in 2020, I became a contributor and corrector for the journal  [L'Heuristique](http://lheuristique.ca/author.php?id=541). I also write poetry and fiction, and I will hopefully soon create a little space on Ravirer for that too.

And for the miscellaneous, I was a guest on the  [Radio du Vieux podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9WT6fEy-qMmn9fk4SN0ww) twice (where I talked about the environmental student movement) and I also did the animation for an [electoral debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA-CnDELIko) in the circumscription of Laurier-Sainte-Marie in 2019.


And for those wondering about what I’ve been reading, I’m putting here two links : one to a  [list of all the books I’ve read since 2018](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Al0exe4DLIOhyQ4pZh4k9G2kYwny?e=90qAbhhttps://1drv.ms/x/s!Al0exe4DLIOhyQ4pZh4k9G2kYwny?e=90qAbh) and a second to my [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/ariane.beaudin/library) where I save my more academic materials.

Profesionally speaking, I can do : 
* Correction of text (in French)
* Writing of all sorts (even personalized erotic stories) 
* Tarot readings 
* Some programming, I am so far a jack of all trades (but I’m good at managing teams)

If you want to know more about me, hire me or collaborate with me, you can send an email at ariane.beaudin@hotmail.com.
