Hello, my name is Ariane Beaudin and I am a non-binary artist, intellectual and activist. My pronouns are elle/she/they. I like to investigate the many ways we can disrupt status quo, namely through the lens of queerness, science-fiction and education.

You can go on my [/now page](http://ravirer.com/now) to know what I'm currently doing. 

In those recent years, I was busy doing a Technique intensive en informatique at the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal, from which I graduated in June 2020. I was also involved in the organization of student strikes for the climate and other social and ecological initiatives in the Cégep du Vieux-Montréal. Before that, I completed a DEC in Histoire et civilisations at the same cegep (2015-2017), and I studied in Relations internationales et droit international at l'Université du Québec à Montréal for a year (2018).

On the writing side, I used to rant (constructively) about education on [Apprendre comme du monde](wwww.apprendrecommedumonde.wordpress.com/). And in 2020, I became for a short period of time a contributor and corrector for the journal  [L'Heuristique](http://lheuristique.ca/author.php?id=541). I also write poetry and fiction, and I will hopefully soon create a little space on Ravirer for that too (update : some of my poetry can now be found under [/poetry](http://ravirer.com/poetry)).

And for the miscellaneous, I was a guest on the  [Radio du Vieux podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9WT6fEy-qMmn9fk4SN0ww) twice (where I talked about the environmental student movement) and I also did the animation for an [electoral debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA-CnDELIko) in the circumscription of Laurier-Sainte-Marie in 2019.


And for those wondering about what I’ve been reading, I’m putting here two links : one to a  [list of all the books I’ve read since 2018](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Al0exe4DLIOhyQ4pZh4k9G2kYwny?e=90qAbhhttps://1drv.ms/x/s!Al0exe4DLIOhyQ4pZh4k9G2kYwny?e=90qAbh) and a second to my [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/ariane.beaudin/library) where I save my more academic materials. I also compiled some of my favorite books over [there](http://ravirer.com/collections/reading_essentials/).

Profesionally speaking, I can do : 
* Correction of texts (in French)
* Writing of all sorts (even personalized erotic stories) 
* Tarot readings 
* Some programming, I am so far a jack of all trades (but I’m good at managing teams)
